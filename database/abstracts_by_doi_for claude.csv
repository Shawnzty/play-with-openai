Educational Robotics: Development of computational thinking in collaborative online learning,"In the previous study the work experience on organization of teaching Robotics to secondary school students at school lessons and in study groups was introduced. This study which was conducted within 2019 and 2021 covered the period of distant learning caused by COVID-19 pandemic and even post-pandemic period, when a part of school students continued learning online. The study deals with the problem of developing school students’ computational thinking in online learning. We consider computational thinking as a set of cognitive skills of solving educational and cognitive problems. The research questions raised were aimed at solving the problem of the influence of Educational Robotics on developing computational thinking. During the research we have found out that due to the adaptability of robots, Educational Robotics, the development of individual learning programs, and the arrangement of collaborative online learning are instruments and a solution to the problem of developing computational thinking. The main components of computational thinking, which were studied within those 3 years, are the following: algorithmic thinking, ability to program, and efficiency in team work. The influence of the learning strategy we chose enabled us to determine the level of computational thinking and its dependence on learning Robotics. We used statistical criteria in order to summarize the results of our research. The statistics provided suggests progress in the indicator tracked. Based on the experimental data received we approximated reliability (R^2) and relevant exponential equation (trend lines). The research we carried out also has led to the general conclusion that Educational Robotics helps to create synergistic learning environment for stimulating students’ motivation, collaboration, self-efficacy and creativity."
"A Sim-to-real Practical Approach to Teach Robotics into K-12: A Case Study of Simulators, Educational and DIY Robotics in Competition-based Learning","Simulators in robotics are well-known tools for the development of new applications and training and integration of systems for remote operation or supervision. Therefore, robotics is one of the most used practices in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics-based educational frameworks, and, with COVID-19, simulators have become increasingly important. This study shows specific benefits achieved for K-12 students in an individualized family service plan/resource teachers for the gifted model based on a review. A simulator is typically adopted for undergraduates students to increase their ability to make technical-based decisions and move smoothly between the real and virtual worlds, with a strong emphasis on the feedback from both. It enables students to develop abilities to build robots without needing commercial kits. In a sim-to-real approach, early simulation allows improved team integration and reduced reliance on skills, equalizing the abilities of students, regardless of their backgrounds. Simultaneously, simulation encourages students to work harder in real implementation by equalizing their class level, resulting in competition-based learning."
Learning robot differential movements using a new educational robotics simulation tool,"The study of robotics has become a popular course among many educational programs, especially as a technical elective. A significant part of this course involves having the students learn how to program the movement of a robotic arm by controlling the velocity of its individual joint motors, a topic referred to as joint programming. They must learn how to develop algorithms to move the end effector of the arm by controlling the instantaneous velocity or some similar aspect, of each joint motor. To support this learning activity, physical or virtual robotic arms are typically employed. Visual observation of the movement of the arm provides feedback to the correctness of the student’s joint programming algorithms. A problem arises with supporting the student in learning how to move the robotic arm with precise velocity along some path, a subtopic of joint programming referred to as differential movements. To develop this knowledge, the student must produce and test differential movement algorithms and have the capability to verify its correctness. Regardless of the type of arm used, physical or virtual, the human eye cannot notice the difference between a correct or incorrect movement of the end effector as this will involve noticing small differences in velocities. This study found that by simulating the process of spray painting on a virtual canvas, the correctness of a differential movement algorithm may be accessed by observing the resulting paint on the canvas as opposed to observing the movement of the arm. A model of a set of spray-painting equipment and a canvas was added to an existing virtual robotic arm educational tool and used in an Introduction to Robotics class offered at Florida Gulf Coast University in Spring 2019 and Spring 2020. The class offered in Spring 2019 used the virtual arm but without the spray-painting feature while the class offered in Spring 2020 used the new spray-painting feature that was added to the virtual arm. Exam results show that 59.4% of the students that used the new feature scored at least an 85% on the corresponding differential movements exam question compared to only 5.6% of the class that did not use the added spray-painting feature. The differential movement exam question simply asked the student to produce a differential movements algorithm to move the arm with a specified velocity alone a straight line."
Transformative Learning: A Decade of Success in Educational Robotics Competition,"This paper explores the multidisciplinary nature of robotics and its integration into STEM education. Drawing on various studies, it highlights the positive impact of robotics on students’ thinking, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. We focus on educational robotics competition entitled “e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC)”, a project-based learning initiative by e-Yantra, a robotics outreach project at IIT Bombay, India. eYRC complements traditional engineering education in India with 74 diverse themes, not only developing technical skills but emphasizes life skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. Our exploratory data analysis presents findings related to task submissions, team formation, and the impact of an electronics backgrounds on performance. The paper proposes a training program to address challenges identified in the analysis and reports on pilot studies conducted with undergraduate students. We highlight the transformative impact of eYRC through theme case studies, participant stories, startup successes, and its resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic preparing students for the challenges of future employment."
Examination of the usability of Tinkercad application in educational robotics teaching by eye tracking technique,"Like all sectors, the education sector has been negatively affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Considering the decision to conduct face-to-face training in schools remotely, teachers had many difficulties in moving course content to the online platform. Teachers who perform robotic coding applications are looking for ways to do these activities remotely. Simulators enable real objects to be animated in a computer environment. There are many paid and free platforms that simulate robotic coding tools. Arduino and Micro:bit, can be simulated on the Tinkercad platform. This study tests the usability of the Tinkercad platform by teachers. In usability tests, users are expected to complete the authentic tasks they must perform on the tested platform. In this study, 12 Information Technology teachers tried to complete 10 authentic tasks in the Circuits section of the Tinkercad platform. Eye movements have been recorded and analyzed while participants perform tasks. Surveys were applied to the participants and data were collected with the observation form during the tests. Consequently, the teachers who completed the usability tests stated that it is appropriate for the platform to be used by teachers and students over 10 years of age and that they can use the platform in their activities."
The Effectiveness of Educational Robotics Simulations in Enhancing Student Learning,"This paper will compare two free versions of robotic simulation programs. All of them aim to offer an entrance into the world of robots in an easy way and with fewer resources. How can it enhance these student learning? This paper will compare two free versions of robotic simulation programs, IDE HedgeHog and Thymio Suite. One system is a web-based simulation in a web browser and does not need an installation. The other is a program on the computer; therefore, a program is to download and install on the computer. Both have different program languages, like text-based or visual-based programming languages, for different difficulty levels. A research design in which 124 students were asked to solve different tasks and responded to an online survey indicates that both simulations are user-friendly and helpful for beginners. They are useful tools to engage students in educational robotics activities or test programme codes in a virtual environment before they are transferred to physical settings."
sBotics - Gamified Framework for Educational Robotics,"This paper proposes a learning framework for Educational Robotics named sBotics, which includes a complete environment for teaching and programming skills acquisition designed for both teachers and K-12 students. Our framework has been developed using a gamified approach with the system and simulated environment developed in the Unity game engine. The main novelty of this platform is its ease-of-use combined with the flexibility to create a variety of scenarios with endless learning potential, in contrast to our evaluations where no alternatives with such characteristics were found for the K-12 range that we are targeting. Also as a contribution of our proposal, robot programs are treated as games that are affected by a disturbance model, which acts in the robotic system and environment variables. This model is introduced in order to approximate what happens in a real robot programming platform. Besides, it is possible for the user, throughout its use, to code in three levels of abstraction: its overly intuitive native programming language called R-Educ, BlockEduc (R-Educ version of Blockly), and C#. Programs can be compiled and interpreted by virtual robots executing any given command. As for teachers, the framework API offers tools that can be employed in the assembly and customization of the learning setup. The whole platform has been built as a tool dedicated to spreading the worlds of Robotics and Programming among youngsters, as well as making them more affordable to everyone. It has been validated by our experiments and is currently being used during the novel Coronavirus pandemic by the official RoboCupJunior Rescue trials in Brazil, currently with more than a thousand competing teams (about 5 thousands students)."
Educational Robotics for Inclusive Design,"This research stems from the need to prepare future teachers to design digital inclusive teaching. The contribution thus presents a distance training course on Coding and Educational Robotics (ER) for pre-service support teachers (PSSTs). The aim was not only to enhance PSSTs’ digital skills but mainly to foster their ability to design for all, using technologies in an inclusive perspective. Trainers supported them without offering predefined work packages. They stimulated PPSTs to become experimenters and researchers to identify functional paths for the introduction of coding-ER in their future curricular teaching. We investigated the evolution of PSSTs’ basic knowledge and self-confidence on coding-ER tools and methodologies and their beliefs on their introduction to PSSTs’ education. We finally detected their satisfaction with this training course. From the results, the training proved to be effective, despite the distance implementation and the lack of an embodied approach. The PSSTs showed a greater self-confidence and a higher awareness about the benefits of ER. They also demonstrated a conscious use of tools and a focus on inclusiveness in the design of learning paths. We can identify the following as success factors: the strong interaction between participants supported by the course structure; the continuous feedback from both peers and trainers; the possibility to experiment in groups and share successes and failures. These positive results have also led to a greater awareness of the role of support teachers in the complexity of classroom life."
Educational Robotics: Methodological Considerations and Practice of Mechatronics,"The paper discusses the current state of educational robotics, specifically its project-based engineering perspective for K-12 students, utilizing a hands-on approach to voluntarily build and use robotic solutions of different complexity in digital fabrication environment. Analysis of student behavior for the given approach is presented. Educational content composition scheme is proposed and demonstrated with practical examples realized with students. Further steps to improve student motivation are considered."
“Experience” on the Screen. Training Pre-service Teachers on Educational Robotics,"Training teachers is relevant for Educational Robotics’ (ER) effective and motivated introduction in schools. Teachers’ self-confidence and beliefs about new technologies are crucial elements for the students’ proficiency. A lack of self-confidence could often prevent the successful implementation of new activities in schools. For this reason, Pre-Service Teachers (PSTs) are a key category to invest in. Furthermore, given the potential of ER to achieve inclusive education, there is a solid reason to train Pre-Service Support Teachers (S-PST) as well. Coding and ER training is indeed generally provided through in-person and extra-curricular courses aimed primarily at in-service teachers. The present study addresses the need for training PSTs and S-PSTs on those topics, also through experiential distance curricular courses. Specifically, we examined PSTs’ and S-PSTs’ knowledge and self-confidence towards ER pre-post training, their beliefs and their satisfaction with the courses. The study also investigates whether a distance experiential pathway can be successful despite the lack of a face-to-face experience. The results are satisfactory not only for improving knowledge but also for the effectiveness in enhancing PSTs’ self-confidence towards ER and coding. We also achieved positive results in terms of beliefs and satisfaction with the course."
A card-based design tool for supporting design thinking in elementary students,"Although educational robotics competitions have become a popular research field in STEAM education, there is a lack of studies concerning the design process that student teams follow to build their solutions. This study aims to propose and evaluate We!Design!ForSTEAM, an approach for supporting design thinking in the context of STEAM and robotics competitions for elementary school students based on a card-based design game. The proposed methodology is derived from participatory design approaches. It is based on 40 design cards, which aim to empower elementary students to empathize with the problem and ideate creatively and efficiently for identifying solutions. It was applied in 6 sessions with the participation of 31 elementary students preparing for an open educational robotics competition. Questionnaires and focus groups were used to gather data from the students who argued that the proposed approach allowed them to explore the problem in an unexpected, creative, and productive way. They managed to identify complex problems and produce innovative solutions utilizing a structured design process with ideation probes. Weaknesses of the framework, primarily focused on time management, were also identified and reported. We suggest that the proposed approach is a first step to creating design thinking methodologies for elementary students in educational robotics and STEAM."
G-ARM: An open-source and low-cost robotic arm integrated with ROS2 for educational purposes,"The high cost of industrial robots limits their accessibility in academic settings. This research addresses this by developing a low-cost, 3D-printable robotic arm for educational use, designed using the open-source tool FreeCAD and affordable hardware components. The robot is integrated with ROS 2 Humble and MoveIt 2, enabling motion planning and control, and includes a simulator for virtual testing and prototyping. The robot was evaluated over eight months in the Industrial Robotics and Software Architectures for Robots courses at Rey Juan Carlos University. It demonstrated durability, ease of use, and practical feasibility, making it a suitable platform for training robotics professionals. This work highlights the potential of affordable robotics to enhance education and provides a scalable, replicable solution for academic institutions."
Robotics Meets AI and Vision in South America (Topical Collection),"The integration of robotics research with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision (CV) has enabled the solution of practical tasks previously challenging with traditional techniques. This interdisciplinary approach focuses on developing intelligent computational systems for decision-making, planning, and object recognition, minimizing human intervention in various domains like e-commerce, healthcare, industry, and more. South American researchers contribute significantly, with emphasis on emerging AI technologies such as Deep Learning, statistical methods, and computer vision applied to robotics. The works within this collection highlight the increasing prominence of robotics in education, with it becoming a part of basic education, and discuss a topical collection showcasing research presented at Latin American robotics events in 2021.

The collection aims to disseminate cutting-edge robotics research and foster collaboration in the field."
Physical Bits: A Live Programming Environment for Educational Robotics,"The use of physical computing devices as teaching tools presents several challenges for educators and learners. Most introductory programming environments help to learn programming by removing the possibility of syntax errors, usually by using a visual programming language. However, understanding syntax is just one aspect of the learning process. One of the most challenging tasks for students is to build a correct mental model of the underlying machine model and its execution dynamics. Additionally, visual programming languages present issues when transitioning to text-based languages. In this paper we present Physical Bits, a web-based programming environment for educational robotics that attempts to solve these issues by providing a live programming experience using both visual and textual programming languages."
A gender differential analysis of educational robots’ effects on primary teachers’ computational thinking: Mediating effect of programming attitudes,"There has been a global consensus to develop computational thinking (CT) in primary education, but the biggest obstacle to promoting CT is teachers’ lack of sufficient CT. This study explored the effects of micro: bit educational robotics (MER) programming activities on primary teachers’ CT and programming attitudes (PA) while considering the teachers’ gender effects. We implemented a single-group pre-test and post-test experiment with 56 primary teachers in China. We also measured teachers’ CT and PA levels before and after the MER activities intervention. The results showed that MER activities significantly enhanced teachers’ CT and PA and had different effects on each dimension of their CT and PA. The analysis of variance by gender showed that male teachers had significantly higher overall CT and PA scores than female teachers. However, female teachers performed better on collaborative skills in CT, indicating that female teachers also have the potential to develop CT. In addition, we found the mediating effects of PA, which means that MER activities affect CT through PA. Furthermore, PA predicted CT positively, suggesting that PA could be a key factor in enhancing CT. This study clarified the mechanism of gender and PA influence on CT during the MER activities intervention, which provides references for future researchers to conduct teacher training."
"A Novel Approach to Teaching Theory Control: Integrating STEM Education, Mobile Robot Simulation, and Bio-inspired Optimization","In the context of engineering education, imparting control theory poses a significant challenge, especially for students lacking prior knowledge in the domain. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a novel approach for teaching control theory using STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education, mobile robot simulator, and bio-inspired optimization. The paper identifies the lack of prior knowledge in control theory as a barrier to effective instruction and proposes a work approach that combines theoretical discussions, hands-on practical exercises, and tests, allowing students to progressively delve into control theory concepts. The study’s results demonstrate a statistical significance positive correlation between students’ performance in practical exercises and test outcomes. By providing a comprehensive framework for teaching control theory in a practical and engaging manner, this research contributes to bridging the gap in control theory education for students from diverse backgrounds."
Turing Machine Development for High Protected Remote Control of the IoT Mobile Platform,"The issues of IoT networks and systems privacy considered with particular focus on mobile robotics remote control. Despite the IT-cybersecurity significant progress, new tasks and threats emerge, such as unmanned mobile devices of mass disposable with remote control, for which known approaches are not efficient enough. In this respect, a novel Turing machine-based method has been developed in this work for high-protected remote control of an IoT mobile platform. An original flow-chart of IoT mobile platform control introduced. A special system-interoperability model originated for IoT-platform remote communication. A Turing machine formalism defined for flexible frame encoding, along with a sender-receiver interaction protocol. A Turing machine tags-table specified on the set of ternary alphabet-symbols, as well as a formal grammar syntax for volatile frame encoding with two typical patterns. A Turing machine algorithm has been constructed for high-protected control of a robotics mobile platform. Due to this, special mobile objects can apply unique low-cost encryption schemes of unpredictable frame encoding to make communication channel harder to hack. The results of the work intend to improve the mobile objects cyber-threats protection, as well as to remote vehicle control and other real-time IoT-applications."
Overview of Tools for Programming and Virtual Simulation of Robots Within the STEM Teaching Process,"Robotics has proven to be a powerful learning tool, not only as a subject of study and an engineering branch, but also for general aspects of studying STEM disciplines. There are numerous areas of engineering technique and science that are included in the STEM concepts of education based on the application of robotics, such as: sensors and actuators, voice recognition, image processing, new technologies in general, the Internet of Things, smart devices, the digital world as a whole, Industry 4.0/5.0, etc. The inclusion of virtual programming environments and simulators in the teaching of robotics can eliminate many limitations, and enable a larger number of students to simultaneously have access to quality teaching at the same level. This paper presents an overview of several robotics programming environments and simulators, which can be an excellent tool for teaching STEM disciplines through programming, modeling and simulating different robots."
The role of task designs on problem-solving and computational thinking processes in elementary school education,"In elementary school classrooms, Computational Thinking (CT) teaching often is embedded in problem- or project-based pedagogies and involves programming using Educational Robotics. Little is known, however, about how children solve problems in these contexts, and how task designs influence which CT and problem-solving processes they apply. In this study, we examined children’s problem-solving and enactment of CT processes in two different task contexts. We analyzed talk and actions of 16 pairs of 8- and 9-year-old children who programmed robots in distinct task contexts: a more structured context (a simulation task) vs. a more open-ended context (a path-finding task). Results showed that in the path-finding task children used increasingly lower-level problem-solving steps and more frequently relied on trial-and-error approaches. A contrasting profile was found in the simulation task. We link the contrasting profiles to task designs and contextual factors. We call for empirical studies of classroom learning activities that enable children to create models of CT teaching, so as to support instructional designers and teachers in the development of task designs aligned with instructional goals and children’s problem-solving and CT skills."
Analysis of Software for Development and 2D/3D Modeling of Robotic Systems in Academia and Industry,"The work is devoted to the review and analysis of software for designing control programs and 2D/3D modeling of the mobile robots for academic and industrial applications. A generalized structural diagram of the hierarchical mobile robot control system with decentralized software processing of information and separate software and hardware components located remote from each other are presented in the paper. Various programming environments which represent a wide range of tools for creating different types models and systems are considered for building the mobile robots and their control systems. Moreover, the issues of using graphic and text software environments with high-level programming languages have been reviewed. LabView, EV3-G, TRIK Studio, ROBO Pro, Arduino and Scratch were considered among the integrated development environments. Player/Stage, Gazebo, RoboDK and others were considered among the software packages for modeling the operation of the mobile robots. Presented examples of academic and industrial software are analyzed according to the following criteria: mathematical expressions, computational models, interpretation, standalone use, code generation, debugging, tutorials, free, platforms, constructors and development prospects. And also robotic systems simulators are considered as tools for testing the efficiency, safety and reliability of control algorithms through 2D and 3D simulations."
Automatic Competitions in the Unibotics Open Online Robot Programming Web,"This paper presents a gamification extension for the Unibotics educational robotics web platform, which provides the ability to organize online international competitions about robot programming. Unibotics includes several robotics challenges, the robots may be programmed in Python from the browser. It is ROS-based, cross-platform and uses Gazebo robotics simulator.

The proposed challenge was to program a Formula 1 car, endowed with a camera, to follow a red line along a race circuit, the faster the better."
Educational Robotics for Creating “Tangible Simulations”: A Mixed Reality Space for Learning the Day/Night Cycle,"Human cognition is guided and shaped by the physical manifestation of objects around us- acting and thinking are intertwined. By integrating digital interactions to the physical world, we improve the potential to perceive and understand objects, spaces and notions and we facilitate the creation of mental representations since these are directly influenced by the way we bodily interact with objects. The integration of educational robotics, mixed reality and tangible interfaces provides us with a fertile ground on which to develop new learning scenarios. Astronomical phenomena, from the simplest to the most obscure include difficult to grasp concepts for which learners usually develop strong misconceptions. In this paper, we propose the use of educational robotics as a tangible simulation tool of the Earth’s movements, in a mixed reality space for learning the day/night cycle. In order to evaluate the proposed environment, a pilot study was conducted with sixteen elementary students. Data were collected through pre/post tests, an attitudes questionnaire and semi-formal group interviews. Students’ answers indicated that they were excited with and impressed by the proposed intervention while the gained invaluable knowledge about the day/night cycle."
Education in the AI era: a long-term classroom technology based on intelligent robotics,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have a major social impact in the coming years, affecting today’s professions and our daily routines. In the short-term, education is one of the most impacted areas. The autonomous decision making that can be achieved with tools based on AI implies that some of the traditional methodologies associated with the fundamentals of the learning process in students, must be reviewed. Consequently, the role of teachers in the classroom may change, as they will have to deal with such AI tools performing parts of their work, and with students making a common use of them. In this scope, the AI in Education (AIEd) community agrees on the key relevance of developing AI literacies to train teachers and students of all educational levels in the fundamentals of this new technological discipline, so they can understand how these tools based on AI work and pilot the adaptation in an informed way. This implies teaching students about the fundamentals of topics like perception, representation, reasoning, learning, and the impact of AI, with the aim of delivering a solid formation in this area. To support them, formal teaching and learning resources must be developed and tested with students, properly adapted to different educational levels. The main contribution of this proposal lies in the presentation of the Robobo Project, a technological tool based on intelligent robotics that supports such formal AI literacy training for a wide range of ages, from secondary school to higher education. The core part of this paper is focused on showing the possibilities the Robobo Project offers to teachers in a simple way, and how it can be adapted to different levels and skills, leading to a long-term educational proposal. Validation results that support the feasibility of this technology in the education about AI, obtained with students and teachers in different educational levels during a period of six years, are presented and discussed."
Metacognitive control during problem solving at early ages in programming tasks using a floor robot,"This research, following a sequential mixed-methods design, delves into metacognitive control in problem solving among 5- to 6-year-olds, using two floor-robot environments. In an initial qualitative phase, 82 pupils participated in tasks in which they directed a floor robot to one of two targets, with the closer target requiring more cognitive effort due to the turns involved. The results of this phase revealed that younger students often rationalised their decisions based on reasons unrelated to the difficulty of the task, highlighting limitations in children’s language and abstract thinking skills and leading to the need for a second quantitative study. In this subsequent stage, involving 117 students, a computerised floor-robot simulator was used. The simulator executed the students’ planned movements and provided feedback on their validity. Each participant had three attempts per problem, with the option to change their target each time. The simulator stored the information pertaining to the chosen resolution path, design of the plan, and re-evaluation of decision making based on the results and feedback received. This study aims to describe the criteria upon which students base their metacognitive control processes in decision making within problem-solving programming tasks. Additionally, through a comparative analysis focusing on age and gender, this research aims to assess the relationship between metacognitive processes and success in problem-solving programming tasks."
Scaffolding Pre-service Science Teachers’ Problem-Solving Strategies in a Methane Gas Detector Task Within an Earthquake-Robotics PD Course,"Educational robotics (ER) has the potential to be a novel approach to teaching geohazards such as earthquakes at the college level. ER, which provides learners with problem-solving settings, requires proficiency in content knowledge and practical application to address ill-defined problems, challenging learners to master problem-solving strategies. Despite several efforts in the existing literature, it is necessary to scaffold the problem-solving strategies comprehensively. This qualitative study investigated the problem-solving strategies of nine pre-service science teachers aligned with a coding scheme containing problem-solving strategies not previously documented together. The participants were assigned to construct a methane gas detector with Tinkercad to mitigate post-earthquake explosion risks for rescue teams in an online robotics-integrated earthquake professional development (PD) course. Qualitative data, including artifacts, observations, and interviews, were analyzed using deductive coding. The results indicated that participants predominantly employed trial and error, expert opinion, and case-based reasoning. They rarely utilized heuristics and intuition and did not use capacity evaluation, prediction, or sketching strategies. Furthermore, the study synthesized different problem-solving strategies into a comprehensive framework, which was used as a coding scheme. This framework helps to clarify problem-solving mechanisms in an ER context, offering a structured approach."
Alphabot2 Revisited: An Educational Tool to Program and Learn Robotics,"In recent years there has been an increasing diversity of educational equipment surrounding the themes of robotics and programming. AlphaBot2 is one of the most comprehensive robots in this field, with great potential for students, especially between ages 15 and 18. In this paper, we tested one of the versions of the Alphabot2 robot that works with Raspberry Pi, which can use Python, a programming language of growing importance in the curriculum of high school students, and that can use, additionally, Linux with ROS. Furthermore, we analyse the opportunities of using it in the context of the different classes and the advantages and pitfalls of selecting it as a tool for learning in the STEAM areas."
Education Robotics in Virtual Environment,"Today, robotic toys and kits are one of the ways to build children’s positive attitude towards technology and robotics, from kindergarten or primary school to university. We take into account not only the age of the learners but also the availability and simplicity of the robots for the youngest students. In the upper grades of primary and secondary schools, pupils gradually work with increasingly complex robots and create more complex programs. At universities, students often design and program real robots that occur in practice. At technical universities, students often design a complete robotic workplace. Robotics is a tool for developing the key competencies of the 21^st century. The task of teachers is not only education, but also the preparation of students for the future and their guidance in choosing a future profession. Robotics develops computer, algorithmic, programming and logical thinking, mathematics and digital literacy, creativity, diligence, manual dexterity, patience and a positive attitude towards technology and self-education. It allows the students and users to make decisions, react to changes, work in a team, present and defend their own ideas and solutions. The article presents specific examples and possibilities of teaching robotics and programming robots in primary school using virtual robots and others virtual programmable kits and toys, which are a suitable tool for teaching construction and programming of robots even in distance education. The use of virtual tools is not a goal, but an emergency solution to a situation when face-to-face teaching must be replaced by a distance study."

China’s use of virtual and augmented reality music simulators for teaching music,"The revolution in information and communication technology, as well as the development of augmented and virtual reality technologies, open up new avenues for the renewal of music curricula in Chinese universities. The experiment included 205 pianists and 169 drummers in their first year. They were assigned to either the control or experimental groups at random. Pianists used the augmented reality-based VRtuos Pro app ( N  = 103) and drummers used the virtual reality-based Smash Drums app ( N  = 85), while the others worked in a traditional environment with traditional instruments. The control group had higher mean values, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant ( p  = 0.00). In the drummer group, however, the interactive programme resulted in greater skill development and statistical significance ( p  = 0.00). As assessment tools, a 100-point ECTS scale and an expert assessment method were used. The information in this article will be useful to those who intend to use augmented reality or virtual reality music simulators in music universities to enhance the quality of their courses. This article aims, among other things, to spark academic debate about the viability of using augmented and virtual reality technologies in music universities in China and other countries."
"Why Educational Robotics May Support Teachers to Discover, to Develop and to Promote Students’ Talent: The GIF4T Approach","Talent is present in any person as an innate potential to think, design and realize innovation. Thus it is something worth to be recognized and correctly stimulated. This paper aims to relate the development of talents to educational robotics (ER) as a way to promote creativity, autonomy, computational thinking, project-based and collaborative learning, constructionist approach, gamification. The ‘Gruppo Insegnanti Formatori’ (Training Teacher Group - GIF) has established the GIF4T initiative to support talent development through ER within the so called T-Labs. After a pedagogical introduction to the talent concept, the paper presents the structure of a T-Lab and its robotic declination. A T-Lab is essentially based on three stages: teaching, experiential learning and talent exploitation through meetings. Then how robots add some relevant enabling factors is explained. The expected results are confirmed by two short case histories in the very specific situation of a remote telematics implementation of the lab (due to pandemic). Some final remarks and ideas of future works complete the contribution."
A Survey of Embodied Learning for Object-centric Robotic Manipulation,"Embodied learning for object-centric robotic manipulation is a rapidly developing and challenging area in embodied AI. It is crucial for advancing next-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest recently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning focuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and perceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in this field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1) Embodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance through various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which focuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented learning, designed to optimize the robot’s performance based on the characteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation. In addition, we offer an overview and discussion of public datasets, evaluation metrics, representative applications, current challenges, and potential future research directions.

Teaching Practical Robotics During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study on Regular and Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulations,"Laboratory experiments are important pedagogical tools in engineering courses. Restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic made it very difficult or impossible for laboratory classes to take place, resulting on a fast transition to simulation as an approach to guarantee the effectiveness of teaching. Simulation environments are powerful tools that can be adopted for remote classes and self-study. With these tools, students can perform experiments and, in some cases, make use of the laboratory facilities from outside of the University. This paper proposes and describes two free tools developed during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down that allowed students to work from home, namely a set of simulation experiments and a Hardware-in-the-loop simulator, accessible 24/7. Two approaches in Python and C languages are presented, both in the context of Robotics courses for Engineering students. Successful results and student feedback indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in institutions in Portugal and in the Netherlands."
A ROS-based Open Web Platform for Intelligent Robotics Education,"This paper presents the new release of the Robotics Academy learning framework and the open course on Intelligent Robotics available on it . The framework hosts a collection of practical exercises of robot programming for engineering students and teachers at universities. It has evolved from an open tool, which the users had to install on their machines, to an open web platform, simplifying the user’s experience. It has been redesigned with the adoption of state-of-the-art web technologies and DevOps that make it cross-platform and scalable. The web browser is the new frontend for the users, both for source code editing and for the monitoring GUI of the exercise execution. All the software dependences are already preinstalled in a container, including the Gazebo simulator. The proposed web platform provides a free and nice way for teaching Robotics following the learn-by-doing approach. It is also a useful complement for remote educational robotics."
Using Mobile Applications to Interact with Drones: A Teachers’ Perception Study,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the perceptions of 60 in-service teachers’ regarding the use of drones through mobile applications. After a brief introduction to drones’ applications, practices and operation through mobile apps, the sample completed tasks that required assembling, programming, simulating and flying drones. Data were collected via an online questionnaire using open-ended questions adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model, namely perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and facilitating conditions. The results showed positive perceptions on using drones through mobile applications. Regarding perceived ease of use, teachers deemed smartphone to drone pairing, programming and simulating mobile apps, and flying the drone to be easy tasks. Regarding perceived usefulness, teachers believed that the use of drones through mobile applications will be useful for them and for their pupils’ learning and will help students to develop a number of skills. Regarding facilitating conditions, teachers indicated the need for teacher training on the pedagogical use of drones, assistance on visual programming and infrastructure support. This study has a number of implications regarding the use of drones through mobile apps in teaching as well as the need for further research on the field of educational aerial robotics."
Design and Evaluation of an XML-Based Language for Programming Socially Assistive Robots,"Robotic technologies have not only been used in factories, but increasingly in various environments in people’s daily lives. Robots are used as assistive devices and through interaction with these devices it is possible to expand the physical and cognitive capabilities of humans. A new class of robots, Socially Assistive Robots (SARs), arises from the intersection of two other classes, assistive robots, which provide assistance, usually in healthcare settings, and interactive social robots, that communicate with the user. This work proposes an XML-based domain specific language (DSL) to facilitate the specification of interactive sessions for SARs. The proposed language is called EvaML and was designed for an open-source robotics platform. Although firstly implemented and used with EVA, EvaML can also be used with other SARs with similar communication affordances. To evaluate the EvaML language, an experiment was conducted with 12 software developers. Participants assessed EvaML with regards to clarity, effectiveness, perceived ease of use and usability according to 9 cognitive dimensions of the CDN framework (Cognitive Dimensions of Notations). EvaML was also successfully used by another group of 12 high school students and teachers in a series of activities where they designed and implemented interactive educational applications for EVA. Results indicate that EvaML is perceived as easy to use and usable, making it an adequate tool to enact interaction designs for a SAR platform considering different user profiles and levels of knowledge."

"Development of a course based on BEAM robots to enhance STEM learning in electrical, electronic, and mechanical domains","In this work, BEAM robotics is proposed to enhance the STEM knowledge and skills of engineering students in the electrical, electronic, and mechanical domains. To evaluate the proposal, a course is designed and implemented based on a curriculum with objectives and learning activities centered on the design, construction, and operation of the BEAM robots. In addition, the connection between this proposal and computational thinking is explored. Students learn to recognize each part of robots and how they are related, abstract useful information from an electronic scheme and concretize it in a machine by systematizing their behavior. In addition, thanks to an evaluation of the behavior of the robot, identify the faults and apply the solution, as in the debugging process carried out in software programming. It should be added that BEAM robotics has a sustainable and low-cost aspect, which is used in learning activities where Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is recycled, and students are taught to value and integrate these parts into the design of the robots. A pre and post survey and a respective statistical analysis and evaluation of curricular activities are presented as evidence of the improvement observed in students’ STEM knowledge and skills. In general, the results show that this new teaching tool can promote the STEM curriculum in engineering students and motivate implementation, as a new educational robot, at other academic levels such as secondary and pre-secondary education."
Experience in Implementing Computer-Oriented Methodological Systems of Natural Science and Mathematics Research Learning in Ukrainian Educational Institutions,"Taking into account the specifics of the existing dissonance regarding the technical characteristics of computer equipment used in schools in the process of designing computer-oriented methodological systems of natural science and mathematics research learning (COMSRL), the solutions which meet all the necessary requirements, contribute to the effective organization of research activities during research studies at school and are a budget alternative to expensive software are offered. The experience is analyzed. With the aim to increase the motivation and effectiveness of students’ learning the ways of solving the problems of designing variable models of research learning using the components of the COMSRL are considered. The results of the experimental study confirm that due to the use of COMSRL the optimal concentration of educational resources is ensured integrating training courses of robotics tested in the educational process and extracurricular activities; orientation of the content and technologies of students’ preparation for research, manufacturing integration in terms of educational process. To organize the students’ cognitive activity in the field of robotics, a number of constructors have been developed that help the students’ to assemble the structure, create the programme and run the robot model. The results of a wide experiment allowed us to determine the most effective psychopedagogical factors that influence the efficiency of mastering knowledge. It has been shown that in determining the feasibility of applying and selecting the COMSRL it is necessary to give preference to those ones that will help students to develop conceptual structures of knowledge."
Performing a Planetary Exploration Mission from the Classroom,"The concept of a newly developed online teacher training course in robotics by the European Space Agency (ESA) Education Office is presented. The course aims at both primary and secondary school teachers, as the activities proposed are appropriate for students from 8 to 14 years old. Teaching scenario and design strategy of online activities are presented along with the space context used to wrap-up the whole activity. A separate paragraph is dedicated in presenting the activity of Remote Coding. This activity contributes to increase the interactivity of the course and gives participants the feeling of operating a real planetary exploration mission. Finally, a statistical analysis from participants’ feedback is presented. Results show a continuous effort of teachers to implement new Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) tools to their classes along with a clear preference on more interactive activities concerning the online content delivery method."
E,"educational robotics A subfield of robotics that deals with the teaching of analysis, design, application and operation of robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles. The corresponding devices consist of hardware, e.g., preassembled device, kit of components, and software, containing source code and programming environments. It can be taught from elementary school to graduate programs and is often applied in robot tournaments."
Medical Robotics,"An impressive growth of theoretical, methodological, and experimental advancements of robotic components and systems in healthcare applications has characterized the last three decades. Robots are able to support prevention, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of human diseases. Several industrial medical robots exist, whose performance, reliability and affordability have made them true success stories and turned—in several cases—research concepts into gold standards in clinical care. This chapter will consider four representative domains of medical robotics: surgery, rehabilitation, limb substitution and assistive technology. In each of these domains, robots have reached a rather high level of maturity, so that very interesting and inspiring stories can be told on various aspects of their evolution. Based on these assumptions and objectives, the remainder of this chapter will address the following topics: (i) motivations for developing medical robots, (ii) robots for surgery, (iii) robots for rehabilitation, (iv) robots for limb substitution and (v) robots for assistive services."
Training School Teachers to Use Robots as an Educational Tool: The Impact on Robotics Perception,"This study investigates whether an educational robotics training program for kindergarten, primary, and secondary teachers causes them to change their impressions of a robotic platform. Questionnaires submitted before and after a 3-month training program were used to assess the opinions of 40 teachers. The training program aided in bringing teachers’ expectations closer to the actual potential of the robot. The course seems to level participants’ impressions: differences between STEM and literary teachers before the program are no longer detected after it. Although those with a wider technological background have more willingness to use the robot, all the teachers, in the end, perceived the robotic platform as appreciated and beneficial for the education of students. Our findings highlight the crucial benefit of a training program in robotics for teachers: it not only provides the knowledge to use a robotic platform but also helps form a more informed vision of the possibilities afforded by robotics platforms for education."
The Features of the Formation of the Functional Basis of Reading for Children with Speech Disorders Using Information Technology,"The article discusses the theoretical and methodological aspect of correctional and developmental work aimed at the formation of a functional basis for reading in children with speech disorders. The content of the comprehensive developmental program for the formation of the functional basis of reading in children with general underdevelopment of speech “I want to read” is presented, effective information technologies used in the process of working with children with speech disorders are described. The purpose of the work program: the creation of effective psychological and pedagogical conditions aimed at the formation of a functional basis for reading in children with general underdevelopment of speech. During the implementation of the program, tasks related to the activation of the dictionary, the formation of a general culture of speech in the process of acquaintance with literary works, the development of sound and analytical skills, the development of attention, perception, memory, thinking, and the education of positive motivation for reading in children were solved."
Teaching behaviors in problem-oriented instruction for robotics education,"Robotics education is valuable for developing students’ 21st century competencies. It is of significant importance for teachers and researchers to explore its effective pedagogies. Robotics learning is interdisciplinary, and the most effective pedagogy is problem-oriented instruction. This type of instruction requires students to independently identify heuristic problems which can be categorized into four types: paradox, critical reflection, anomaly, and practice problems. School students are too young to develop sophisticated self-regulated learning, thus requiring guidance from teachers. However, how teachers can best guide students to solve these four types of problems remains unclear. Accordingly, this study aimed to investigate teaching behavioral patterns in the instruction of a robotics course. The participants were 30 seventh-grade students and a teacher. We proposed a Teaching Behavior Coding Scheme and used Lag Sequential Analysis to analyze the course videos to identify various major teaching behaviors and their sequences in the heuristic problems. The results showed that the behaviors included indirect influence, direct influence and wait time. Indirect influence occurred more often than direct influence, and it is argued that enough wait time should be provided in the instruction. Moreover, the results further suggest that paradox is missing from this instruction. The teaching behavior patterns for the three types of problems are discussed. The findings propose a new method to analyze teaching behavior patterns, and also recommend how teachers can support students learning in interdisciplinary robotics courses. The results contribute to the literature by designing the Teaching Behavior Coding Scheme and confirming its use in a robotics course."
Robotics Laboratory Within the Italian School-Work Transition Program in High Schools: A Case Study,"This paper presents a robotics laboratory originated by the collaboration between the university and high school within the Italian school-work transition program. The educational objective of the proposed lab is twofold: 1) ease the transfer of robotic researchers’ expertise into useful means for the students’ learning; 2) teaching by practice the multidisciplinarity of robotics. We exploited the RoboCup Junior Race as a useful scenario to cover topics from 3D printing for fast prototyping to low-level and high-level controller design. An ad-hoc end-of-term student survey confirms the effectiveness of the approach. Finally, the paper includes some considerations on how general problems in the robotic and scientific community, such as gender issues and COVID-19 restrictions, can impact the educational robotics activities."
How to Promote Learning and Creativity Through Visual Cards and Robotics at Summer Academic Project Ítaca,"This paper presents a robotics workshop that aims to encourage high-school students to enrol at university STEAM-related degrees. It is included in a socio-educational program in which we have been involved for several years. The workshop attendees become familiar with the concept of robotics through a set of visual cards that we recently introduced, called STEAMOLUS cards. These cards introduce real-world problems to be solved while learning the basics of robotics. The results suggest theses cards contribute to develop students’ creativity and inspiration."
Theoretical and empirical models underlying the teaching use of LMS platforms in higher education: a systematic review,"The Learning Management Systems (LMS) have garnered attention in Higher Education due to their significant potential as a robust learning tool; however, their mere existence does not guarantee adoption and acceptance. The objective of this study was to analyze quantitative research on the intention and usage of LMS among university professors. The method employed was a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines. Databases such as Scopus, WOS, EBSCOhost, and SciElo were explored from 2013 to 2023. The results indicated that (a) the most frequent objective was to determine factors influencing LMS usage, (b) the average number of participants was 239, (c) the highest productivity (61%) was observed in Asia, (d) the most common limitation about the sample, (e) the most frequently used theoretical model (69%) was the Technology Acceptance Model, (f) the models also included other variables grouped into personal, technological, social, and institutional factors; (g) The predictive power of the models on LMS usage intention was moderate, while for current LMS usage, it ranged from small to moderate; (h) measurements were self-reported; (i) ultimately, the majority measured only the intention of LMS usage (54%), 15% measured only the current usage of LMS, and 31% measured both. In conclusion, limitations, future research directions, and recommendations for the integration and consolidation of LMS usage by faculty are presented."
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation,"Numerous fields, such as the military, agriculture, energy, welding, and automation of surveillance, have benefited greatly from autonomous robots’ contributions. Since mobile robots need to be able to navigate safely and effectively, there was a strong demand for cutting-edge algorithms. The four requirements for mobile robot navigation are as follows: perception, localization, planning a path and controlling movement. Numerous algorithms for autonomous robots have been developed over the past two decades. The number of algorithms that can navigate and control robots in dynamic environments is limited, even though the majority of autonomous robot applications take place in dynamic environments. A qualitative comparison of the most recent Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation techniques for controlling autonomous robots in dynamic environments with safety and uncertainty considerations is presented in this paper. The work incorporates different angles like the essential technique, benchmarking, and showing parts of the improvement interaction. The structure, pseudocode, tools, and practical, in-depth applications of the particular Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for autonomous mobile robot navigation are also included in the research. This study provides an overview of the development of suitable Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques for various applications."
Off-policy evaluation for tabular reinforcement learning with synthetic trajectories,"This paper addresses the problem of offline evaluation in tabular reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a novel method that leverages synthetic trajectories constructed from the available data using a “sampling with replacement” basis, combining the advantages of model-based and Monte Carlo policy evaluation. The method is accompanied by theoretically derived finite sample upper error bounds, offering performance guarantees and allowing for a trade-off between statistical efficiency and computational cost. The results from computational experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves lower upper error bounds and relative mean square errors compared to Importance Sampling, Doubly Robust methods, and other existing approaches. Furthermore, this method achieves these superior results in significantly shorter running times compared to traditional model-based approaches. These findings highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of this synthetic trajectory method for accurate offline policy evaluation in RL."
Aerial Robots: To Use or not to Use Them in Teaching and Learning?,"The aim of this study was to examine pre-service and in-service teachers’ perceptions regarding the use of drones in teaching. The study sample consisted of 80 pre-service and 101 in-service teachers. After a brief introduction to drone technology, the participants completed tasks that required assembling, programming, virtually simulating and flying 16 multirotor drones. Data were collected via an online questionnaire using variables and questions adapted from the Theory of Planned Behavior. The results indicated that pre-service and in-service teachers showed positive attitudes, intention and behavioral beliefs towards using drones in teaching. A positive correlation between attitudes and intention was found. Results also indicated that a number of pupil skills and subjects will be enhanced by using drones in the classroom. Finally, pre-service teachers had stronger intentions and more positive attitudes, behavioral beliefs and perceptions compared to in-service teachers. This study has a number of implications regarding the use of drones in teaching as well as the need to develop teacher training programs in order to successfully integrate drone technology into future classrooms."
Using mobile applications in the study of vocal skills,"This article reflects the results of a study involving second- and fourth-year students from Harbin University (Harbin, China), the Chinese Academy of Arts (Hangzhou, China), and the Central Academy of Drama (Beijing, China). The work analyzed the impact of specialized mobile applications Vox Tools: Learn to Sing and Swiftscales Vocal Trainer on the vocal learning process, depending on the age and gender of students. The study, which ran from February to June during the academic year 2020-2021, involved 180 students. The study confirms the effectiveness of multimedia, demonstrating the higher scores of the experimental groups on the five assessment criteria, compared with the control groups, which did not use mobile applications. It was also found that age in two groups of students (second and fourth year) had no effect on performance, regardless of whether the mobile app was used for vocal training. A correlation was found between age and overall student performance, with second-year students showing lower grades in all groups compared to their fourth-year counterparts. Research on current mobile vocal training apps can help improve vocal learning."
Open Design Meets Robotics - Customizable Educational Robot Construction System,"The aim of the described design assignment was to develop modular and customizable construction kit for building the mobile robotic platforms with various controller boards. The project was co-developed by Institute of Design and Institute of Automotive Mechatronics at STU in Bratislava. Authors have applied the principles of open design to create fully functional, ready to use construction of an educational robot, fully produced by low cost FDM 3D printing technology. The paper describes the broader context of the project, development and prototyping of the Acrob3 platform."
Promoting Microelectronic Through Remote FPGA Based Laboratory,"Educational continuity has been made possible by the fact that teacher education and teacher collaboration systems have evolved rapidly to provide teachers with the knowledge and skills they need both to adopt new pedagogies and to support students and their families during the pandemic. Therefore, it is recommended that the ongoing professional development of teachers be more integrated into the organization of their educational work. Now, what tools can we offer students to continue doing practices from home in the same way as if they were in the university's laboratories? It seems that more than ever remote laboratories are the solution or perhaps the best alternative. A remote laboratory could be defined as a set of hardware and software technologies that allow the user, through the Internet, to carry out an experiment in the same way as if they were in the face-to-face laboratory. There are a lot of benefits of using remote laboratories in the learning process. From our side, and what is the object of this contribution, we have developed a series of seminars through which we develop educational content around microelectronics. During these remote access seminars, attendees have been able to use LabsLand's remote FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) laboratories to experiment while developing the theoretical contents and challenges proposed."
Learning Newtonian Physics through Programming Robot Experiments,"Novel technology has been applied to improve students’ learning abilities in different disciplines. The research in this field is still finding suitable methodologies, tools, and evaluation mechanisms to devise learning frameworks with high impact on students’ performance. This article describes an instructional method to perform Newtonian physics experiments by programming a mobile robot. Such experiments allow the learners to design, implement and visualize physics concepts, thus using the robot as a cognitive tool or mindtool . An accurate assessment of the students learning gain, involving 29 high-school students, shows that the proposed method provided significant improvements in the students understanding of the first Newton’s law, the second Newton law and the superposition principle. The learning gain has been measured through the Force Concept Inventory questionnaire. From this study, we can state that programming a mobile robot to perform physics experiments can improve knowledge about Newtonian physics, even without giving specific lectures in the subject and with a much shorter lecture plan with respect to traditional lectures."
Integrating LLM-based code optimization with human-like exclusionary reasoning for computational education,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as intelligent tutors that not only generate but also refine source code for educational purposes. Yet existing end-to-end fine-tuning strategies compel models to transform every input, often introducing superfluous or even detrimental edits that undermine both software quality and pedagogical clarity. We address this limitation by formulating exclusionary reasoning-the human practice of asking “Should I optimize?” before acting-as an explicit decision layer in the code-optimization pipeline. Concretely, we devise a two-stage framework in which an LLM first diagnoses whether a code segment merits modification and proceeds with optimization only when necessary, otherwise returning the original snippet verbatim. Implemented on a suite of open-source models and trained with publicly available Python corpora, our method proves model-agnostic and lightweight. Experiments on three standard benchmarks show consistent gains in functional correctness (pass@1/3/5) over conventional fine-tuning, yielding feedback that is both more accurate and easier for students to interpret. By aligning automated optimization with human selective judgment, the proposed framework transforms LLMs from indiscriminate code generators into credible virtual teaching assistants that intervene sparingly, explain clearly, and foster deeper learning of principled programming practices."
Game-Based Storytelling with a Robot Character: Activating Computational Thinking in Young Children,"Computational thinking (CT), defined through its dimensions of abstraction, generalization, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation, fosters cognitive skills for solving problems logically and systematically, preparing individuals for the challenges of the digital society, where interaction with machines is essential. This empirical pre-experimental study arises from an individualized intervention with students aged 4–6 (N = 82), aimed at measuring their level of CT. Its originality lies in involving them in a story featuring a robot, whose mission is to help a turtle recover its habitat. To achieve this, they must program the robot to follow a predetermined route and overcome various challenges. Thus, the CT-Robot-DST scale was designed and validated, consisting of 14 indicators with 4 performance levels, to record the observed level of CT during the intervention (27′ 30′′ per child). This scale assesses their skills in task planning and sequencing, logical reasoning, lateralization, spatial orientation, understanding and identifying the buttons to program the robot’s movements, memorization, counting, eye-hand coordination, problem-solving, effectiveness, and engagement with the story. The results show that the majority of the students engaged in the story, expressed interest in planning and executing the required tasks, successfully programmed the robot, solved problems, and overcame the proposed challenges. Thus, 78.1% of the students scored close to the high CT level. The more autonomous students performed better. Undoubtedly, this intervention, focused on completing various tasks structured around a narrative featuring a robot, represents an innovative approach that involves students in the storyline to solve the challenges."
"How are primary school computer science curricular reforms contributing to equity? Impact on student learning, perception of the discipline, and gender gaps","Background Early exposure to Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking (CT) for all is critical to broaden participation and promote equity in the field. But how does the introduction of CS and CT into primary school curricula impact learning, perception, and gaps between groups of students? Methodology We investigate a CS-curricular reform and teacher Professional Development (PD) programme from an equity standpoint by applying hierarchical regression and structural equation modelling on student learning and perception data from three studies with, respectively, 1384, 2433 and 1644 grade 3–6 students (ages 7–11) and their 83, 142 and 95 teachers. Results Regarding learning, exposure to CS instruction appears to contribute to closing the performance gap between low-achieving and high-achieving students, as well as pre-existing gender gaps. Despite a lack of direct influence of what was taught on student learning, there is no impact of teachers’ demographics or motivation on student learning, with teachers’ perception of the CS-PD positively influencing learning. Regarding perception, students perceive CS and its teaching tools (robotics, tablets) positively, and even more so when they perceive a role model close to them as doing CS. Nonetheless, gender differences exist all around with boys perceiving CS more positively than girls despite access to CS education. However, access to CS-education affects boys and girls differently: larger gender gaps are closing (namely those related to robotics), while smaller gaps are increasing (namely those related to CS and tablets). Conclusion This article highlights how a CS curricular reform impacts learning, perception, and equity and supports the importance of (i) early introductions to CS for all; (ii) preparing teachers to teach CS all the while removing the influence of teacher demographics and motivation on student outcomes; and (iii) having developmentally appropriate activities that signal to all groups of students."
Vsimgen: A Proposal for an Interactive Visualization Tool for Simulation of Production Planning and Control Strategies,"We propose the development of an interactive visualization and analysis tool, Vsimgen , for production planning and control (PPC) strategies to be analyzed with simulation generator software ( simgen ). This generic and scalable discrete simulation model is commonly used to deal with optimization problems in PPC, such as MRP II (manufacturing resource planning). The concept is to provide an easy to use visual interface that hides complex details and can execute multiple steps of discrete simulations for PPC using various user interactive and visualization options for data selection and preprocessing, parameterization, and experimental design. We also emphasize collaboration by users from various domains of industrial production. With collaboration, effective PPC strategies can be executed that consider various production details provided by domain experts, managing different production-related tasks, and yielding better insight into the various production-related problems."
"Relations between preservice teachers’ self-efficacy, computational thinking skills and metacognitive self-regulation","Computational thinking skills are thought to have a significant part in almost every area and profession in the future. Yet, there is no sufficient number of studies in the literature to understand computational thinking and to reveal its nomological network. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the relations between preservice teachers’ self-efficacy for learning and performance, computational thinking skills and metacognitive self-regulation. A total of 464 preservice teachers in a public university participated in this study. The Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire was used to measure preservice teachers’ self-efficacy for learning and performance and metacognitive self-regulation. In addition, the Computational Thinking Scale was used to determine the preservice teachers’ computational thinking skills. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Pearson’s correlation, confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis. Results showed that preservice teachers’ computational thinking skills were significantly positively correlated with self-efficacy for learning and performance and metacognitive self-regulation."
"Mendieta, One Robot Per School: Multi-user Robot for Technology Education","In recent years, the use of physical computing devices in Argentinian schools has been growing steadily. The insertion of robotics in the classroom allows addressing a set of technology-related subjects, such as mechanics, electronics, and programming. It is no coincidence that the Argentine educational system has incorporated these subjects into its curricular design, as well as the introduction of new technical schools aimed at programming and robotics. However, the cost of the equipment, the difficulty of maintenance, and the technical knowledge required to be able to properly use this resource in an educational context are limiting factors that hinder the potential to reach all schools. For these reasons, a project has been designed to overcome these difficulties: a low-cost autonomous robot controlled by an Arduino Nano, with a web server built into an Orange Pi computer, which allows programming by multiple users at the same time, queuing the execution orders in such a way that with a single device an entire class can work seamlessly. This allows the introduction of robotics in a school with a cost of less than USD 180. Additionally, all the development of both hardware and software is open source, offering the community a framework for building other robots with the same architecture."
Exploiting VR and AR Technologies in Education and Training to Inclusive Robotics,"Nowadays, robotics applications are no more limited to industrial rigid production cells or research laboratories and are spreading in several domains in which interaction with humans is required. In this context, educating professionals, workers, and students in the use and understanding of robotic systems is paramount to ensure the social acceptance and uptake of interactive robots. At the same time, the request for innovative training and teaching methodologies is growing, and virtual and augmented reality technologies as educational tools are gaining the attention of public institutions, companies, and healthcare facilities. In this paper, we focus on how VR/AR technologies can be exploited to teach robotics and to train in the use of specific robot platforms, providing a review of the available resources and discussing their advantages and disadvantages in the “inclusive robotics” perspective."
Robotics in the international educational space: Integration and the experience,"Nowadays robotics is one of promising avenues in the sphere of emerging technologies. In the teaching/learning environment we deal with educational robotics, which is a mixture of theory and practice, knowledge of computer technology, Mathematics and Physics. The two vectors are combined in educational robotics: the educational vector and the technological vector. As an academic discipline and an area of practical application, Robotics means a very broad spectrum of modern knowledge of diverse academic engineering specialties (fields of expertise). That means that Robotics is interdisciplinary in nature. The work provides an overview of the research aimed at studying Robot – Man interaction. Besides, the work considers some promising international cooperation between children from around the world on the development of robotics, and the experience and benefits gained from such cooperation. As an example of the international cooperation in the sphere of Robotics, the two countries, Russia and Kazakhstan, are considered. The article gives an example of the international cooperation of some educational centers, describes the experience of the work on robotics with children of various ages, and the cooperation of various schools working in this field in Kazakhstan and Russia. The working experience in the sphere of social robotics aimed at helping people has become a priority for the children from the interdisciplinary teams from Russia and Kazakhstan. Interaction and cooperation in the sphere of robotics was also used for introducing unconventional curricula, which included courses on robotic technologies as tools for considering social aspects of robotics and artificial intelligence."
"Tell, Draw and Code – Teachers’ Intention to a Narrative Introduction of Computational Thinking","The increasing importance of introducing computer science and computational thinking in primary education highlights the need to prepare teachers adequately. This study reports on professional teacher training in programming. It draws on the Technology Usage Inventory (TUI) model to investigate how an interdisciplinary intervention with programmable robots, combined with the storytelling method, can influence the intention to use them in the classroom. Special focus is given to the Tell, Draw & Code method to offer teachers a didactic concept for implementation. The floor robots used in this study are Bee-bots. At the beginning and end of the teacher training course, the participating teachers completed a questionnaire about their perceptions, attitudes, and intentions about using robots in the classroom. In addition, after designing and implementing activities with robots, the teachers provided qualitative reflections on their experiences. In comparing pre-and post-test and the analyses of the qualitative data, the study shows a significant increase in the positive attitude towards using the robots. These findings highlight the need for teachers to have opportunities to explore, reflect on and experience the potential of new technologies as part of their teacher development to implement innovations sustainably."

Artificial Cognitive Systems Applied in Executive Function Stimulation and Rehabilitation Programs: A Systematic Review,"This article presents a systematic review of studies on cognitive training programs based on artificial cognitive systems and digital technologies and their effect on executive functions. The aim has been to identify which populations have been studied, the characteristics of the implemented programs, the types of implemented cognitive systems and digital technologies, the evaluated executive functions, and the key findings of these studies. The review has been carried out following the PRISMA protocol; five databases have been selected from which 1889 records were extracted. The articles were filtered following established criteria, to give a final selection of 264 articles that have been used for the purposes of this study in the analysis phase. The findings showed that the most studied populations were school-age children and the elderly. The most studied executive functions were working memory and attentional processes, followed by inhibitory control and processing speed. Many programs were commercial, customizable, gamified, and based on classic tasks. Some more recent initiatives have begun to incorporate user-machine interfaces, robotics, and virtual reality, although studies on their effects remain scarce. The studies recognize multiple benefits of computerized neuropsychological stimulation and rehabilitation programs for executive functions in different age groups, but there is a lack of studies in specific population sectors and with more rigorous research designs."
Disrupted Lessons in Engineering Robotics: Pivoting Knowledge Transfer From Physical to Virtual Learning Environments,"This study examined the effects of an Arduino microrobot activity on college students’ interest in robotics through three specific objectives: (1) determining how students’ conceptual understanding regarding the basics of microcomputing and computer programming changes after engaging in an engineering robotics learning module, (2) assessing the impact of these changes on students’ sense of competence in engineering robotics, and (3) explaining the role of students’ perceived knowledge transferability in the relationship between their sense of competence and changes in their interest for pursuing engineering robotics. Participants (n = 58) were recruited from two Engineering Physics courses and surveyed before (Time 1) and after (Time 2) an Arduino microcomputing learning activity. First, significant increases were reported post-activity for interest in robotics, as well as conceptual understanding of microelectronics and computer programming. Second, changes in the understanding of computer programming significantly predicted students’ sense of competence at Time 2. Finally, high and low levels of competence and perceived knowledge transferability were related to changes in students’ interest in robotics. Moreover, high levels of perceived knowledge transferability alone played an important role in students’ interest in robotics. Transferring complex engineering ideas to novel situations was beneficial regarding students’ learning gains associated with computer programming and with the Arduino microcontroller platform. An overview of the virtual lab architecture used is provided with suggested novel directions for teaching college-level courses about engineering robotics."
Project-first approach to programming in K–12: Tracking the development of novice programmers in technology-deprived environments,"Several instructional approaches have been advanced for learning programming. However, effective ways of engaging beginners in programming in K–12 are still unclear, especially among low socioeconomic status learners in technology-deprived learning environments. Understanding the learning path of novice programmers will bridge this gap and explain what constitutes an effective learning path for novice. Thirty-eight students from technology-deprived schools participated in a 10-h project-first constructionist learning. Using the Friedman test of repeated measures and Spearman’s rank correlation, trends in the students’ programming ability were evaluated. The findings showed that the students’ programming ability increased on the first day, remained stable throughout the intervention, and were not affected by either semantics or syntax of the Python programming language. However, the features of a program were inconclusive determinants of programming skills. The irregular patterns of programming concepts within and between the learners’ programming solutions suggest focusing on pedagogies that encourage project-first learning. A constructionist model of learning and the challenges educators may encounter amongst novice learners with low socioeconomic status are highlighted."
Performance Enhancement of a Neato XV-11 Laser Scanner Applied to Mobile Robot Localization: A Stochastic Modeling Approach,"Laser scanners are widely used in mobile robotics localization systems but, despite the enormous potential of its use, their high price tag is a major drawback, mainly for hobbyist and educational robotics practitioners that usually have a reduced budget. The Neato XV-11 Laser Scanner is a very low cost alternative, when compared with the current available laser scanners, being this fact the main motivation for its use. The modeling of a hacked Neato XV-11 Laser Scanner allows to provide valuable information that can promote the development of better designs of robot localization systems based on this sensor. This paper presents, as an example, the performance enhancement of a Neato XV-11 Laser Scanner applied to mobile robot self-localization, being used as case study the Perfect Match Algorithm applied to the Robot@Factory competition."
Introducing Maker Movement in Educational Robotics: Beyond Prefabricated Robots and “Black Boxes”,"Nowadays, several studies assure that digital fabrication and making technologies, if coupled with proper learning methodologies such as constructivism and constructionism, can provide learning experiences that promote young people’s creativity, critical thinking, teamwork and problem-solving skills – the essential skills necessary in the workplace of the twenty-first century. Robotic technologies combined with digital fabrication and DIY electronics emerge as unique making tools that can create a learning environment attracting and keeping learners interested and motivated with hands-on, fun learning activities. The “maker movement” is seen as an inspiring and creative way for youth to deal with our world and able to develop technological interest and competences. However, in the field of educational robotics, the focus is often on prefabricated robots and ready-made code to program behaviours for the robots. This way, robotics is conceived as “black box” for children who are invited to play or interact with a robot without understanding “what’s inside” and how it works. The project eCraft2Learn researched, designed, piloted and evaluated an ecosystem intended to introduce digital fabrication and maker movement in formal and informal education, to make robots transparent for children and finally to help them make their own robotic artefacts."
Erwhi Hedgehog: A New Learning Platform for Mobile Robotics,"Erwhi Hedgehog is one of the smallest mobile robots. It enables mapping and vision analysis, and also displays machine learning features. Behaving like a small, curious animal, eager to explore the surroundings, the robot can be used to test navigation, mapping and localization algorithms, thus allowing the prototyping of new hardware and software for robotics. This application is particularly handy for educational robotics, at both high school and university level. On the one hand, the project is fully open source and open hardware under MIT license and available on Github, so everyone can build his/her own Erwhi Hedgehog robot with the aid of a step-by-step guide. On the other hand, students with more advanced knowledge can use it as a prototyping platform for developing new software programs and features. Erwhi uses Intel RealSense, AAEON UP Squared and Myriad X VPU technologies, with software based on the Robotic Operating System (ROS), and implements SLAM algorithms, such as RTAB-Map. The machine learning aspect is based on the OpenVINO framework and a dedicated ROS wrapper was used. The software package includes all the programs needed to create a Gazebo simulation. In terms of hardware, motor control is based on an STM32 microcontroller and the Arduino software, and the robot works on the differential drive unicycle model. Finally, Erwhi is compatible with AWS RoboMaker tools."
Towards the Achievement of Path Planning with Multi-robot Systems in Dynamic Environments,"Recent advances in technology lead to the use of robotic systems as part of the modern working environment. Single and multiple robotic systems work closely with humans to accomplish desired tasks, and the recent advancements have made the usage of multi-robot teams more appealing. One critical problem in utilizing the robot’s full potential is the Path planning problem and, while in the case of a single’s robot, path planning has been extensively investigated, in the case of Multiple Robotic Systems (MRS), especially in dynamic changing environments, there are significant open challenges. Based on the statement mentioned above, a detailed survey has been conducted to highlight these challenges and identify potential solutions. In addition, the beneficial use of MRS is presented, as opposed to single robotic systems through the literature, and already-achievable industry-related results are provided. It is concluded that the practical application of path planning in dynamic environments using MRS is still a field of research and development, requiring the community to engage more with practical applications."
Making Sense of Maritime Simulators Use: A Multiple Case Study in Norway,"This paper reports a multiple case study of a training center collaboration with three offshore companies and a coastline authority. Through a qualitative inquiry, we utilized the actor-network theory to analyze the common understanding of simulator use in these organizations. The paper argues that the simulator itself is an actor that can integrate shared interests with other actors to establish an actor-network. Such an actor-network expands simulator use beyond purely training purposes. It advocates that the simulator is a medium between maritime academia and industry and aligns it with the same actor-network to facilitate the process of “meaning construction.” Such a meaning construction process offers simulator-based training with a valuable definition of the learning outcomes. It helps clarifying who will gain the benefits from simulator use in the future, as well as when and on what basis. The paper also reflects on the benefits and limitations of utilizing a multiple case study in the maritime domain."

This Italian school includes kindergarten, primary, and secondary schools. The Institute had already in place a variety of technological tools well integrated into the daily lessons. This has favoured the mandatory shift from a face to face methodology to a distance learning that the lockdown situation has forced. The characteristics of the new learning environment for each school type are summarized as well as, the experience of “adopting schools” to support other schools in implementing distance learning."

"The MRS UAV System: Pushing the Frontiers of Reproducible Research, Real-world Deployment, and Education with Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","We present a multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control and estimation system for supporting replicable research through realistic simulations and real-world experiments. We propose a unique multi-frame localization paradigm for estimating the states of a UAV in various frames of reference using multiple sensors simultaneously. The system enables complex missions in GNSS and GNSS-denied environments, including outdoor-indoor transitions and the execution of redundant estimators for backing up unreliable localization sources. Two feedback control designs are presented: one for precise and aggressive maneuvers, and the other for stable and smooth flight with a noisy state estimate. The proposed control and estimation pipeline are constructed without using the Euler/Tait-Bryan angle representation of orientation in 3D. Instead, we rely on rotation matrices and a novel heading-based convention to represent the one free rotational degree-of-freedom in 3D of a standard multirotor helicopter. We provide an actively maintained and well-documented open-source implementation, including realistic simulation of UAV, sensors, and localization systems. The proposed system is the product of years of applied research on multi-robot systems, aerial swarms, aerial manipulation, motion planning, and remote sensing. All our results have been supported by real-world system deployment that subsequently shaped the system into the form presented here. In addition, the system was utilized during the participation of our team from the Czech Technical University in Prague in the prestigious MBZIRC 2017 and 2020 robotics competitions, and also in the DARPA Subterranean challenge. Each time, our team was able to secure top places among the best competitors from all over the world."
Learning Robotics: a Review,"Purpose of Review With the growing interest for STEM/STEAM, new robotic platforms are being created with different characteristics, extras, and options. There are so many diverse solutions that it is difficult for a teacher/student to choose the ideal one. This paper intends to provide an analysis of the most common robotic platforms existent on the market. The same is happening regarding robotic events all around the world, with objectives so distinctive, and with complexity from easy to very difficult. This paper also describes some of those events which occur in many countries. Recent Findings As the literature is showing, there has been a visible effort from schools and educators to teach robotics from very young ages, not only because robotics is the future, but also as a tool to teach STEM/STEAM areas. But as time progresses, the options for the right platforms also evolve making difficult to choose amongst them. Some authors opt to first choose a robotic platform and carry on from there. Others choose first a development environment and then look for which robots can be programmed from it. Summary An actual review on learning robotics is here presented, firstly showing some literature background on history and trends of robotic platforms used in education in general, the different development environments for robotics, and finishing on competitions and events. A comprehensive characterization list of robotic platforms along with robotic competitions and events is also shown."
Usable and Accessible Robot Programming System for People Who Are Visually Impaired,"In the 1960s, Papert introduced Logo language that commanded a graphic turtle. These were the first advances in the field of educational robotics. Many environments were created in this theme; however, most programming environments are highly graphical, so they do not provide accessible interfaces for visually impaired users. Thus, our research presents challenges and recommendations in terms of usability and accessibility in designing a robot programming environment for people who are visually impaired. We conjectured that by using a programming language to guide a robot in a virtual environment, the person who is visually impaired could better understand orientation and mobility skills. Hence, we created the GoDonnie programming language based on the Logo language. GoDonnie runs in a programming environment called Donnie. We show all the design process of Donnie, that was based on interactive design. Participates in this study, people who are visually impaired and sighted programming professors. Results indicate that GoDonnie and Donnie have good usability, supports the development of orientation and mobility in visually impaired people, and meets the expectations regarding the programming environment. Finally, we created a set of design guidelines for developing robot programming environments for people who are visually impaired."
Dimensions of robotic education quality: teachers’ perspectives as teaching assistants in Thai elementary schools,"Educational robots have been used in many countries as teaching assistants in elementary schools but robotic education quality is not well established in Thailand. The primary objective of this study was to identify and confirm quality dimensions in robotic education from the teachers’ perspectives. The sample size was 510 teachers who were observed in Thai elementary schools. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) indicated a good fit of a six-factor model to the observed data. The construct of CFA revealed six dimensions of robotic education quality as Social interaction, Cognitive function, Teaching method, Learner characteristics, Main features and Content . Results were similar to previous studies. Prototype development of an educational robot was proposed in relation to the Thai educational context. Further research, including large random comparative studies, needs to be performed."
A CNN-Based Grasp Planning Method for Random Picking of Unknown Objects with a Vacuum Gripper,"Robotic grasping is still challenging due to limitations in perception and control, especially when the CAD models of objects are unknown. Although some grasp planning approaches using computer vision have been proposed, these methods can be seen as open-loop grasp planning methods and are often not robust enough. In this paper, a novel grasp planning method combining CNN-based quality prediction and closed-loop control (CNNB-CL) is proposed for a vacuum gripper. A large-scale dataset is generated for CNN training, which contains more than 2.3 million synthetic grasps and their grasp qualities evaluated by grasp simulations with 3D models. Unlike other neural networks which predict grasp success by assigning a binary value or grasp quality level by assigning an integer value, the proposed CNN predicts the grasp quality via a linear regression architecture. Additionally, the method adjusts the grasp strategies and detects the optimal grasp based on feedback from a force-torque sensor. Various simulations and physical experiments prove that the CNNB-CL method is robust for random noise disturbance in observation and compatible with different depth cameras and vacuum grippers. The proposed method finds the optimal grasp from 2,000 candidates within 300 ms and achieves a 92.18% average success rate for different vacuum grippers, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods regarding success rate and robustness."
Lessons from Delivering a STEM Workshop Using Educational Robots Given Language Limitations,"Educational robots are increasingly being used in schools as learning tools to support the development of skills such as computational thinking because of the growing number of technology-related jobs. Using robots as a tool inside the classroom has been proved to increase motivation, participation and inclination towards STEM subjects at both primary and secondary levels; however, language has usually not been considered as a mitigating factor. This paper reports our experience delivering nine workshops in English, using Thymio robots, to over two hundred students aged 9–12 across a week in the French cities of Nancy and Metz. Our goal was to test whether students would still have fun, learn something new and gain an interest in STEM even when the workshop was conducted in a foreign language. Our results indicate that using language that is easy to understand, although foreign, has a strong direct correlation (p $$\sim 10^{-3}$$ ) with having fun and that the latter positively affects learning and increased interest in STEM."
A Guide for 3D Mapping with Low-Cost Sensors Using ROS,"Open source software and low-cost sensors bring unquestionable advantages to the robotics community, facilitating the access to a wide range of robotic applications to virtually anyone, and playing an important role in recent advances. With the progressive overthrown of the cost barrier, development of robotic solutions has become more widespread among our society, as witnessed by the increase of service robotic applications to consumers. Despite the ease of access to low-cost sensors nowadays, knowledge of sensor integration and robotics middleware is still imperative to design successful robotic solutions. In this tutorial chapter, we provide an educational guide that leverages open source tools, such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), and low-cost sensors, such as the Microsoft Kinect v2, to design a full 3D indoor Mapping system. The ultimate goal of the system is to create a comprehensive and detailed 3D map of any indoor environment. Besides going through all the key steps to setup such a system and presenting interactive results, we also provide an experimental dataset that we hope can be useful to the community in the future."
Improving Students’ Concepts About Newtonian Mechanics Using Mobile Robots,"In this paper we proposed an educational robotics project using MARRtino mobile robot to students of Italian high schools, aged from 15 to 19 years old. The MARRtino Educational Robot for high school project (MHS) lasted 70 h during the 2017/2018 school year. Students teams built a mobile robot and programmed it to participate to RomeCup 2018 competition and to make experiments in their school Physics Laboratory. We measured if the educational robotics activity improved students Physics concepts learning, Technology perceptions and attitudes, and perception of collaborative work attitudes. Moreover, the by-product of the educational activity was to broaden participation of young students in the technology field and to enrich the high school Physics Laboratories with a new technological and educational tool, a mobile robot."

The proposed method was implemented in a virtual robotics system using the V-REP software and in communication con MATLAB. The results show that the optimization of the input fuzzy membership functions improves the navigation behavior against an empirical tuning of them."
Teaching with Open-Source Robotic Manipulator,"In this paper we present and evaluate the usage of an open-source robotic manipulator platform, that we have developed, in the context of various educational scenarios that we have conducted. The system was tested in multiple diverse learning scenarios, ranging from a summer school for primary-school students, to the course at the university level study. We show that the introduction of the system in the educational process improves the motivation as well as acquired knowledge of the participants."
Toward a Smart Pedagogy: Devising a Methodology for Innovation,"A plethora of practical suggestions could be considered to make pedagogy smarter, more active, and attractive to students while simultaneously being efficient and obtaining results. Creative suggestions are not always innovative. In order to achieve innovation, an interesting method is proposed by Jean-Charles Cailliez and described here, consisting of four main steps: (i) following the path indicated by Boethius and Thomas Aquinas in the Middle Ages to acquire a mens ingeniosa , a kind of creative imagination resulting in inspiration , properly obtained from a few conditions and possibilities, restricted by appropriate observations, and underpinned by correct prospections; (ii) insight and enlightenment for the ideation of creativity will be greatly facilitated by co-design within a team; (iii) after the ideation, generated by inspiration, then comes the time for implementation , that is, creating prototypes of projects in an interactive manner and generating pedagogical actions capable of being tested by experimentation; and (iv) innovation , when the idea materializes itself and may be carried out and be useful. Nevertheless, innovation requires steps of its own, such as incubation, creation of a pilot project, testing, acquiring value, and devising possible uses. For any hypothetical use of an idea, creativity indicates when, how, and in which contexts we should use it. Next, we must design an experiment in order to know how efficient of a pedagogical strategy it is and, eventually, have such resource available for specific, didactic goals. Pedagogy should not be centered only on unique and exclusive resources, but ensure an articulated relationship with other resources. A final discussion is proposed considering whether a smart pedagogy will require smart technologies, with some indications about the importance of the role of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, in such innovation scenarios."
Exposing Robot Learning to Students in Augmented Reality Experience,"This paper considers a learning process in which the student teaches the robot new tasks, such as lifting unknown weights, via reinforcement learning procedure. Using CAD software, we ran virtual trials using the robot’s digital twin in place of physical robot trials. When performing the task, the robot measures and sends the value of the weight to an IoT controller implemented on the ThingWorx platform and receives parameters of the optimal posture found through the virtual trials. When we presented the robot learning process to high school students they had difficulty fully understanding the robot’s dynamics and selection of posture parameters. To address this difficulty, we developed an augmented reality interface which allows students to visualize robot postures on the digital twin and monitor the change in parameters (such as the center of gravity) measured by virtual sensors. The student can select a weightlifting posture and control the robot to implement it."
Augmented intelligence in educational data mining,"Educational data mining (EDM) processes have shifted towards open-ended processes with visualizations and parameter and predictive model adjusting. Data and models in hyperdimensions can be visualized for end-users with popular data mining platforms such as Weka and RapidMiner. Multiple studies have shown how the adjusting and even creating the decision tree classifiers help EDM end-users to better comprehend the dataset and the context where the data has been collected. To harness the power of such open-ended approach in EDM, we introduce a novel Augmented Intelligence method and a cluster analysis algorithm Neural N-Tree . These contributions allow EDM end-users to analyze educational data in an iterative process where the knowledge discovery and the accuracy of the predictive model generated by the algorithm increases over time through the interactions between the models and the end-users. In contrast to other similar approaches, the key in our method is in the model adjusting and not in parameter tuning. We report a study where the potential EDM end-users clustered data from an education setting and interacted with Neural N-Tree models by following Augmented Intelligence method. The findings of the study suggest that the accuracy of the models evolve over time and especially the end-users who have a adequate level of knowledge from data mining benefit from the method. Moreover, the study indicates that the knowledge discovery is possible through AUI."
Humanoid Robots in Education: A Short Review,"Robots are becoming useful parts of the education ecosystem with their various capabilities ranging from the ability to perceive people and their environment to the ability to reason and rationalize situations and emotions of people. These robots are also equipped with multimodal interaction capabilities and, equally important, have a physical presence. Humanoid robots, with their humanlike appearance, add another dimension of humanlike body language and social signaling capabilities: keys for more natural and intuitive human-robot Humanoid robot in education Educational robots interaction. This chapter presents the applications of humanoid robots in education. The aim of this chapter is not to provide a complete review of all ongoing research works in robot-in-the-loop education but to create awareness about various educationally oriented applications of humanoid robots. The chapter will also discuss the set of the key capabilities such robots should possess, some major R&D challenges, and some ethical and social issues. Therefore, the chapter aims to serve as basis for further investigation for the interested readers."
Middleware for Multi-robot Systems,"Recent advances in robotics technology have made it viable to assign complex tasks to large numbers of inexpensive robots. The robots as an ensemble form into a multi-robot system (MRS), which can be utilized for many applications where a single robot is not efficient or feasible. MRS can be used for a wide variety of application domains such as military, agriculture, smart home, disaster relief, etc. It offers higher scalability, reliability, and efficiency as compared to single-robot system. However, it is nontrivial to develop and deploy MRS applications due to many challenging issues such as distributed computation, collaboration, coordination, and real-time integration of robotic modules and services. To make the development of multi-robot applications easier, researchers have proposed various middleware architectures to provide programming abstractions that help in managing the complexity and heterogeneity of hardware and applications. With the help of middleware, an application developer can concentrate on the high-level logic of applications instead of worrying about low-level hardware and network details. In this chapter, we survey state of the art in both distributed MRS and middleware being used for developing their applications. We provide a taxonomy that can be used to classify the MRS middleware and analyze existing middleware functionalities and features. Our work will help researchers and developers in the systematic understanding of middleware for MRS and in selecting or developing the appropriate middleware based on the application requirements."
